        <title>Rock a Bye Baby</title>
        <h1>Lullaby Lyrics</h1>
        <p>Rock a bye baby, on the tree top,<br>
            When the wind blows the cradle will rock.<br>
            When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,<br>
            And down will come baby, cradle and all.<br><br><br>
            
            Rock a bye baby, gently you swing,<br>
            Over the cradle, Mother will sing,<br>
            Sweet is the lullaby over your nest<br>
            That tenderly sings my baby to rest.<br><br><br>
            
            From the high rooftops, down to the sea<br>
            No one's as dear as baby to me<br>
            Wee little hands, eyes shiny and bright<br>
            Now sound asleep until morning light<br><br><br>
            
            Rock a bye baby, on the tree top,<br>
            When the wind blows the cradle will rock.<br>
            When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,<br>
            And down will come baby, cradle and all.<br></p>
